## Travis CI

As you maybe know, as other github repositories we use Travis CI tests as a second factor of checking quality of code, bugs, misspelling etc. 
It includes multiple checks where all must be passed without error. Exception makes misspelling pull requests. Please make sure you fix all bugs from CI. Before that we cannot merge your pull request. 

## Test on real hardware

Before accepting your pull request we must make sure it works on real device perfectly without any bug. Please make sure you test the code on a real piece of hardware before making any pull request.

Thanks for your interest!
