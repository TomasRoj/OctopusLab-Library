# ESP32 examples

## About

This section of the examples folder includes some basic examples that work on ESP32. It's currently the main board what we use on our modules. Every example includes comments so you should understand everything just fine.

Fork and test the examples here. We are trying to fix all known bugs in our example but you know, time is everything :-D.
