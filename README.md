# OctopusLab-Library 🌊🐙
Arduino library for @octopusengine that make easier work with pins on their boards 🎉🔥

## How it works ❓

This library make easier to work with pins on octopus engine boards. When this library is included it defines all the pins and you 
can just use them. Just dont must worry about fining theese pins in documention etc. For all the pins
please see the Pins & Support section below. This library also includes basic setup of all the 
components availibe. To setup them just call a function (list of them is in the "functions()" section.

## Pins & Support 💻

Currently is supported only one board from octopus lab boards - robotboard. So pins below are for
this board. ‼ This library is currently in heavy development ‼ That means even the library itself 
can be a full of bugs and cant compile because we are still working on it. We will  be gladd if you will 
help us. To do so please visit the "Contribution" setion.

Motor n.1 - MOTOR1
Motor n.2 - MOTOR2
Motor n.3 - MOTOR3
Motor n.4 - MOTOR4

Bulit in led - led

Servo n.1 - servo1
Servo n.2 - servo2
Servo n.3 - servo3

## Functions() 🎶

setupLed()
led_blinking() - Blink a led diod
setupMotors()
setupServo()
setupAll() - Setups all of the components.

## How to use this ⁉

To use this library, please install it via Arduino Library Manager (not availibe yet) and make
instance of the library (octopuslibrary instance() ).

Then just call one of the functions and you are ready to go! 😊

## Contribution 👏✌

We are glad that people like you helps to build better future of electronics projects.
Like other github projects this github repo has a issue tab with current issues in this
project. But, please respect all the rules included in the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file to
